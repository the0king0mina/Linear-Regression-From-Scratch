# Linear Regression from Scratch

This project demonstrates how to build a **Linear Regression** model completely from scratch without using high-level libraries like `sklearn`.

## 📘 Description
- Implements linear regression using basic Python and NumPy.
- Shows step-by-step derivation of the cost function and gradient descent.
- Includes evaluation using R² Score.

## 📁 Files
- `notebook/Linear regression From Scratch.ipynb`: The full implementation with explanations.

## 🛠️ Libraries Used
- numpy
- matplotlib

## 🚀 Learning Outcomes
- Deep understanding of the linear regression algorithm
- Mathematical intuition behind gradient descent
- Hands-on implementation of optimization
